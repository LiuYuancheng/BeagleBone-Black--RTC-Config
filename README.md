### Introduction

The BeagleBone-Black doesn't have a embedded Real-Time Clock module, so if we powered off it and reboot it, if it is not connected to the internet, its time will be reset. We want to add a RTC unit to it so the program we run on the BBB will have RTC. 

We follow this tutorial link to do the RTC config:
